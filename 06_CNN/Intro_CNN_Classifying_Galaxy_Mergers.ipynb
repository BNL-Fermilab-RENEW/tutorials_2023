For example, multiple edges at different angles can be used to detect curves, and different kinds of wavelets might be combined to identify textured patterns.\n","\n","In functional form, a neural network might look something like this:\n","\n","$$ {\\rm CNN}(x) = {\\rm Layer_{\\rm final}} \\Big [ \\cdots \\Big ( {\\rm Layer_2} \\big ( {\\rm Layer}_1(x) \\big ) \\Big) \\Big ], $$\n","\n","where each layer might contain a convolutional layer and other ingredients (see section below).\n","\n","![Credit: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/what-is-the-convolutional-neural-network-architecture/](https://editor.analyticsvidhya.com/uploads/90650dnn2.jpeg)\n","\n","\n","How do convolutions work?

Images flow through the network one batch at a time, so the inputs should be arrays of size  (𝑁batch size,𝑁filters,𝑁height,𝑁width) . For example a batch of 64 three-color  100×100 images has the array shape  (64,3,160,160) .\n","\n","Batch normalization (batchnorm) is a mechanism that keeps the distribution of activations close to a Gaussian distribution to allow the model to train better.\n","\n","**Pooling** - As we go deeper into the network the number of filter increases! To lessen the computational burden, we rely on pooling layers: often max pooling or mean pooling are commonly seen. For example, if you double the number of filters, but halve the height and width of the output image by using max pooling with a  2×2  kernel, then you still have fewer outputs than from the preceding layer!\n","\n","**Activation funcitons** - they add nonlinearities to the network allowing us to combine huge number of neurons and build comlex models. The rules of linear algebra state that the product of any number of matrices can be represented by yet another matrix. If you want something that's not represented by just a single matrix, you need a non-linear function in between neural network layers.

Go back to Section 4 (\"Train the CNN to perform a classification task\") and increase the number of epochs to 100 (or more!) and train again. Does your model perform better? Your results may look better/worse/different from the published results due to the stochastic nature of training.\n","\n","\n","- **Can I try a different model?  I think the results could be improved.** Yes!  You can try adding layers, swapping out the max pooling, changing the activation functions, swapping out the loss function, or trying a different optimizer or learning rate.  Experiment and see what model changes give the best results. You should be aware:  when you start training again, you pick up where your model left off.  If you want to \"reset\" your model to epoch 0 and random weights, you should run the cells to make and compile the model again.\n","\n","\n","- **I want to test my model on my training data!** No. You will convince yourself that your results are much better than they actually are.
